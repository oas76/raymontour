FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
